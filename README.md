# ml-puf-hardware-security
Course project on PUF-based hardware security (CS771). Explored vulnerabilities of Arbiter PUFs using ML, recovered 256 hidden delay parameters, and applied 91-D feature mapping. Implemented Logistic Regression &amp; Linear SVC with 30% faster convergence, highlighting ML-driven attacks on secure hardware.
